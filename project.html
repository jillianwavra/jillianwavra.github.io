		<p style="text-align:left">One of my most recent projects is my digital newsletter that I made in Digital Technology. It is a newsletter for a group of our choosing and I chose the Minnesota Orchestra. Inside the newsletter is a bunch of recent events they have or are going to be doing. I created the graphics using Adobe Illustrator and put everything together in Adobe InDesign.</p>

		<h2>Website</h2>
		<main>
		<p style="text-align:left">Working on the website has expanded my knowledge of coding and what goes into creating a website. The biggest challenge when creating the website would be trial and error of the elements within it. There would be times where you are so certain of your code only to realize one small mistake that allows it to work perfectly. Having and eye for detail was definitely reqired for this.</p>
		</main>
		
		<h2>Web Game</h2>
		<main>
		<p style="text-align:left">My main issues when working on the game was ensuring everything went with the main theme of the site. I had many times where the individual colors were overriding the css sheet inwhich I had to change it to fit. The game itself also had caused issues with my navigation; disturbing the alignment. Finding a fix to reformat the navigation to look like the other extensions was also an issue.</p>
